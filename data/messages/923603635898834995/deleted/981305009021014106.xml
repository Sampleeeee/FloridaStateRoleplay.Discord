    <Content>Well guys its been one hell of a ride. I have truly had so much fun on this server and I want to thank everyone that made that possible. Lately ive just been getting bored of the whole fivem thing as a whole. The only reason I truly wanted to get on was to hangout with my friends. But as most of you know they have pretty much all left. So this will be my official resignation as Lieutenant Frank.</Content>
